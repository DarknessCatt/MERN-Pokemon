# MERN-Pokemon

MERN-Pokemon is a little training project done to understand more of the MERN framework.

The main ideia is having a react frontend, express backend and mongodb database to create a website where the user can search basic pokemon attributes.
The mongodb data used can be found [here](https://github.com/ATL-WDI-Exercises/mongo-pokemon).
